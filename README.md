# Sound-Splitter-2
Split an audio file into pieces while listening

This is a utility I wrote and use for splitting one audio file into smaller pieces.
My use case is splitting up audio files containing vocabulary into pieces for my
[anki](https://github.com/dae/anki) flashcards.

After compiling, run with `java SoundSplit filename.wav outputname`,
where `outputname` is the string that newly created files should start with.

Currently SoundSplitter will only work with .wav files.
